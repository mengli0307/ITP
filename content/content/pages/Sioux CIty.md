# First time homeowners need to do this
## Genertated by gpt2
When you get your mortgage or insurance, it covers the amount that you fix your house. Thankfully, you don't need to start a homeowner's association (HOA) when you get a mortgage. But you should consider an HO3 or HO4 before you do. HOA insurance is more expensive than homeowners insurance, as you’re paying for a policy that doesn’t reflect the risk of burglary or fire. Plus, your insurer typically charges a separate fire and burglary deductible in the event that your home is damaged.
Is fire and burglary going up? What's the reason? The answer to those questions will inform your decision about whether you would be interested in buying fire and burglary coverage or looking into coverage in the future.
Your lender will require that you get flood insurance in the event that your home is flooded. Your lender will also require flood insurance in the event that your water is contaminated with harmful water source contamination.
Your mortgage company will require flood insurance in the event that your home is located in floodplain
Your water source
Flooding is the leading cause of accidental damage, earning third rank in the Insurance Information Institute’s "Whopper" report, behind only two deadly weather events (Hurricane Hermine in 2004 and Hurricane Charley, in 2005) and lagging behind only three other causes of damage (damaging your home, breaking your windows, and losing your personal belongings).
According to the Insurance Information Institute’s (III) fire insurance ranking, which uses a methodology similar to the “Delta Zona” ranking, we’re behind The Florida Stormwave.
According to the Insurance Information Institute’s (III) fraud index, we’re one of the bottom 20 percent of states for coverage.
In some areas, flood insurance is required for a floodplain area. Flooded areas are typically granted flooding status, which means they also need flood protection. You can check for your floodplain’s flood date and see if your floodplain’s flood date is on the associated flood map.
If you survive and work your way out of the moldy, moldy crawlspace, the guardrail dee you’ll walk down will be the same level of protection you’d be in without flood coverage. Keep in mind that American Flood Insurance Association (AHIA) flood maps show areas that have flood damage
